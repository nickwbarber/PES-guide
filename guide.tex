Research suggests that the way that people explain things that happen in their lives can be revealing.\footnote{\label{seligman89}Schulman, P., Castellon, C., \& Seligman, M. (1989). Assessing explanatory style: The content analysis of verbatim explanations and the attributional style questionnaire. Behavior Research and Therapy, 27(5), 505-512} % TODO: try to find a more appropriate citation; preferably one that doesn't talk as much about the questionnaire (or perhaps just mention the questionnaire)
A consistently pessimistic \emph{explanatory style}, for example, can help indicate depression.
The ability to detect these explanations, and consequently describe a person's explanatory style, is therefore a valuable skill for therapy-minded Companionbots since it lets them know when and about what to start a therapeutic dialogue.

\section{Event Attribution Units (EAUs)}
In order to describe a person's explanatory style, we need a sample of how they explain things that happen to them (particularly things about which the person has a non-neutral opinion). % TODO: briefly describe CAVE analysis and difference from questionnaire
This sample is made up of a set of \emph{event-attribution units}\footnote{\label{CAVE}appendix of CAVE paper, with guidelines} (EAUs) and some descriptive features about them. % TODO: citation needed
EAUs are the conjunction of an \emph{event} and an \emph{attribution} that explains the existence of the event.
 

\subsection{Events}

Seligman provides a fairly comprehensive definition of what is meant by \emph{event} in his annotation guidelines: % TODO: cite, revise "his"

\begin{quote}
    An event is defined as any stimulus that occurs in an individual's environment or within that individual (e.g. thoughts or feelings) that has a good or bad effect from the individual's point of view.
    Events can be mental (e.g. I was afraid), social (e.g. I got a pay raise) or physical (e.g. I got in a car accident).
    Events should be unambiguously good or bad from the individual's point of view and may occur in the past, present or hypothetical future.
    Events that have good and bad elements, neutral events or events that do not affect the \emph{S} [the individual] should not be extracted.
\end{quote}

\pagebreak
While we do attempt to follow this definition as closely as possible, we find that it is easier to reproduce similarly formed \emph{events} in our own verbatim transcripts by requiring several conditions be true about our events, in addition to the definition given above:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \emph{event} must have been mentioned during conversation.
    \item The \emph{event} must have been expressed with a complete sentence spoken in conversation.
    \item The \emph{event} must be in the form of a complete sentence or otherwise corefer with a complete sentence present in the transcript expressing such event.
    \item The \emph{event} must \emph{propose} an \emph{event}.
    \item The form of the \emph{event} must be essentially similar to that of some expression of the \emph{proposition} of that \emph{event}. % TODO: give examples as reasons
    \item The individual is not determined to have experienced the event solely by means of a generic statement. e.g. not ``Teachers often feel stressed'' even when the individual is a teacher.
    \item \emph{Events} must be the minimal length necessary to satisfy all other given conditions.
\end{enumerate}
Some definitions:
\begin{description}
    \item[propose, \emph{also \emph{proposition}, etc.}] to make a statement about something which could be evaluated as either \emph{true} or \emph{false},
        e.g. \emph{a bell rang repeatedly}, but not just \emph{a bell} or \emph{to ring} or \emph{repeatedly}.
    \item[corefer, \emph{also \emph{coreference}, etc.}] to share a single reference,
        e.g. ``\emph{Paul} had a great time" and ``\emph{He}'s always in a good mood."
\end{description}

\section{Annotating Event-Attribution Units and their Features}

    \subsection{Annotation Phases}
    \subsubsection{Phase 1: Event spans}
    For every EAU identified:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Annotate text span of the event as type \texttt{Event}.
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Phase 2: Attribution spans}
    For every event within the given consensus set:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Annotate text span of the associated attribution as type \texttt{Attribution}.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Annotate the identification number of the associated event as a feature, \texttt{Caused\_Event\_ID}.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsubsection{Phase 3: Attribution dimensionality}
    For every attribution within the given consensus set:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Annotate values for each of the three dimensions as features, \texttt{Personal--External}, \texttt{Permanent--Temporary}, \texttt{Pervasive--Specific}, each with a digit betwen \texttt{1} and \texttt{7}.
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Annotation conditions}
    \subsubsection{Events}
    For every \textbf{\emph{event}} annotation:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \emph{event} must have been mentioned during the given conversation.
            \item The event must have been or otherwise be very probable to have been evaluated as either good or bad by subject in terms of its effects on the subject.
            \item The text span that expresses the \emph{event} must be in the form of a complete sentence or otherwise unambiguously \emph{corefer} with a complete sentence present in the transcript expressing such event.
            \item The text span that expresses the \emph{event} must primarily \emph{propose} that event. %...", and nothing else."? % TODO: give examples as reasons
            \item Experience of the \emph{event} by the participant must not rely solely on a generic statement.
                e.g. not ``Teachers often feel stressed'' even if the individual is in fact a teacher.
            \item The text span expressing the \emph{event} must be the minimal length necessary to satisfy all other conditions.
        \end{enumerate}


    \subsubsection{Attributions}
    For every \textbf{\emph{attribution}} annotation:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \emph{attribution} must have been mentioned during conversation.
            \item The text span that expresses the \emph{attribution} must primarily \emph{suggest} that attribution. %...", and nothing else."?
            \item \emph{Events} must be the minimal length necessary to satisfy all other conditions.
            \item The causal relationship identified between the attribution and its associated event must have clearly been intended to have been communicated.
        \end{enumerate}


    \subsubsection{All annotations}
    For \textbf{every annotation} made:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Annotations may be non-contiguous.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Use \emph{annotation}\texttt{\_continuation}, replacing \emph{annotation} with the type name of the continued annotation, e.g. \texttt{Event\_continuation}.
                    \item Annotation continuations must not be interrupted by a complete annotation of the same type.
                \end{enumerate}
            \item Annotation spans may fail to provide all relevant information and remain valid only if nearby contextual information relieves the insufficiency.
        \end{enumerate}


    \subsubsection{EAUs}
    \textbf{Every \emph{EAU}}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item must consist of the nearest pair of annotations for which both spans satisfy their respective conditions, except:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item when an attribution is repeated in such a way that does not seem to be merely sentence repair (e.g. stuttering, clarification, etc.)
                    % TODO: start a "common mistakes" section and put this in it -> \item When the same \emph{event} is mentioned multiple times, for which an \emph{attribution} is given only once, only the nearer text span will be included, \emph{provided} the nearer span does not significantly rely on contextual information to meet it's other conditions.
                \end{enumerate}
            \item must not overlap in its event and attribution spans.
        \end{enumerate}
